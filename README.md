Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms: Lecture by Philip B. Stark.

We reject poisson model for the data. It doesn't fit.
We have our own predictor. The alarm model. This model appears to be competitive to the ETAS model. We want to improve
Tau*mu^Magnitude so as to make the model as competitive or more competitive than the ETAS model. 
We want to show that our model which has only 1 free parameter is better than the ETAS model.

We will build from other people's code. 

We will gather our data online.

Understanding ETAS:
Simulating ETAS
Using ETAS to predictic process: 
Optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditoinal intensity
turn on alarms when the conditonal intensity is above some thresholdudent 

Things we need to do....
Reach grad. student for his code. 
Install etas.f; port etas.f to Python if we can't find an implementation in Python
Download data from SCEC   
Replicate grad student's dissertation results  and try to replicate the plots....

OH 
Sat. and Sunday. One or one time. Schedule time on b...
